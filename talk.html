<h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-1" >

<h3>A little quiz for starters</h3>
<p>
Moshe is looking at Yael, and Yael is looking at Eli. Moshe is married, but Eli is not. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A) Yes
</li>
<li>B) No
</li>
<li>C) There is not enough information to derive the correct answer.
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-2" >

<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>
The human brain is wired to accept the first seemingly fit answer that comes to mind when considering a problem.
It makes sense from an evolutionary point of view: heuristics speed up the process of finding a solution. Speed is important for survival.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-3" >

<h3>Reasoning and Logic</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Psychologists concur with philosophers in the irrelevance of logic to everyday reasoning. Decades of work on Wason’s selection task seem to confirm this. — Pascal Engels
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-4" >

<h3>Thinking, Fast and Slow</h3>
<p>
Following Daniel Kahneman’s terminology, the brain works in two modes, system 1 and system 2. System 1 is the thinking that is fast, intuitive, and unaware of its workings. System 2 is the slow thinking able to correct system 1’s mistakes. The problem is that we often fail to recognize when we need to switch gear and slow down. 
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-5" >

<h3>So, programming are we?</h3>
<p>
Question: When we program, do we use system 1 or system 2?
</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">
We use both. When we learn or face a difficult part of the program, we use system 2, but most of the time we’ll try to maximize system 1 and proceed fast to use what we’ve learnt, what we already know.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-6" >

<h3>Regularity</h3>
<p>
Learnability of a system (programming language) depends on the regularity it provides. When we learn a language, We develop intuitions around it. We are able to predict that the runtime is going to do y if we write x. 
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-7" >

<h3>How do you infuse regularity to a programming language?</h3>
<p>
By making it adhere to well-defined rules.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Computation is a process following a well-defined model expressed as, for example, an algorithm, or a protocol. — Wikipedia
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Models of computation are extremely useful to inventors/designers of high-level programming languages.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them" — Alfred North Whitehead
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-8" >

<h3>Models of computation, some examples</h3>
<p>
Turing Machines, Cellular Automata, Finite State Machines, Stack Machines, Graph Automata, Lambda Calculus, Fractran, Tiling Systems, Chemical Reaction Systems, Hopfield Networks, Boltzmann Machines, Neural Networks, Circuits, Graphical Models, Boolean Algebra, String Rewriting Systems, Semigroups, Quantum Waves, Diophantine Equations, Tag Systems, The Actor Model, etc.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-9" >

<h3>Models of computation</h3>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some models of computations are more succesful than others.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dobiasd/articles/blob/master/programming_language_learning_curves.md">Learning Curves for several programming languages</a>
</li>
<li>Lambda Calculus is at the heart of the most highly regarded programming languages: Haskell, ML and Lisp.
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-10" >

<h3>Lambda Calculus</h3>
<p>
Alonzo Church developed a notation for arbitrary functions. His notation is called λ-calculus (“lambda calculus”). Church introduced his formalism to give a functional foundation for Mathematics but in the end mathematicians preferred (axiomatic) set theory. The λ-calculus was re-discovered as a versatile tool in Computer Science by people like McCarthy, Strachey, Landin, and Scott in the 1960s.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-11" >

<h3>Haskell</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The thing I am the proudest of is that 25 years since we built the first prototype of GHC, its intermediate language is still the Lambda Calculus. So it really takes this enormous language – I mean, Haskell is really a very big language now — and it squeezes it all down into this tiny little language that really just has variables, application, lambda, let – you don’t really need let, but it’s very helpful – case and then the only thing we’ve added recently is  coercions, a single addition to the intermediate language in 25 years, which is just amazing. — Simon Peyton Jones
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) uses an intermediate language, called “Core,” as its internal program representation within the compiler’s simplification phase. Core resembles a subset of Haskell, but with explicit type annotations in the style of the polymorphic lambda calculus (Fω).
</p>

<p>
ghc-core: A convenient command line wrapper for GHC that displays GHC's optimised core and assembly output in a human readable, colourised manner, in a pager. Unix systems only, currently.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
That’s all it is. And it’s testament to the expressiveness of system F, John C. Reynold’s work. — Simon Peyton Jone

<h3>What did McCarthy discover?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you try to answer the question, what is the smallest number of operators you need in order to write an interpreter for a language in itself, Lisp is what you get. In other words, Lisp is not something John McCarthy invented, so much as something he discovered. – Paul Graham
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-14" >

<h3>Seven operators</h3>
<p>
If you have seven primitive operators (quote, atom, eq, car, cdr, cons, and cond) then you can define another function, eval, that acts as a Lisp interpreter.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://leanpub.com/readevalprintlove002">A primordial Lisp described in detail.</a>
</p>

<p>
Lisp has non-functional data, like atoms and numbers and such, so this would count as "untyped lambda calculus extended with constants."
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-15" >

<h3>S-expressions</h3>
<p>
S-expressions are a notation for tree-structured data, invented for and popularized by the programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data.
</p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/Corrected_S-expression_tree_2.png"  height="242" width="242">

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-clojure"><span style="color: #2aa198;">(</span>* 2 <span style="color: #b58900;">(</span>+ 3 4<span style="color: #b58900;">)</span><span style="color: #2aa198;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With S-expressions, code and data share the same representation.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-16" >

<h3>M-expressions</h3>
<p>
S-expressions are an accident of History. M-expressions were intented to be the user syntax. S-expressions were intended to be an intermediate language.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The initial implementation of Lisp was expected to be a very long process, as compilers at the time were expected to take years to write. Implementation began with hand-compiling particular functions while the M-expression sublanguage was still tentative.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hand-compiling the function eval is a very easy task, and a community of S-expression Lisp programmers quickly developed. M-expressions fell into neglect, and were never implemented.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-17" >

<h3>Context-free grammar (ALGOL-derived syntax)</h3>
<p>
Most modern programming languages (C, Java, Ruby, Perl)  are designed with context-free grammars. They are often called C-like languages, or ALGOL-family languages. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by Adriaan van Wijngaarden and which bears his name. Van Wijngaarden grammars use a context-free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program. — Wikipedia
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-18" >

<h3>Lisp takes off</h3>
<p>
LISP became a common language for artificial intelligence (AI) programming, partly owing to the confluence of LISP and AI work at MIT and partly because AI programs capable of "learning" could be written in LISP as self-modifying programs. Since then, it has expanded in a family of dialects, regularly reincarnating in new shape and form but always retaining the same core semantics.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-19" >

<h3>The importance of Lisp in the industry</h3>
<p>
Contributions to programming as we know it today. A long list of ideas that originated with Lispers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>garbage collection
</li>
<li>tree data structures
</li>
<li>if-then-else structure
</li>
<li>dynamic typing
</li>
<li>homoiconicity
</li>
<li>metaprogramming
</li>
<li>self-hosting compilers
</li>
<li>interactive environment
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="sec-1-20" >

<h3>Syntactic abstraction</h3>
<p>
The argument making the case for Lisp languages is that of extensibility. No special power to the language designers over its users. This is a property of homoiconic languages. Traditionally, the most defining feature of Lisp.  
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-1-21" >

<h3>Enlightenment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. — Eric Raymond
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
90% of what you learn while studying your first Lisp will carry over to your next. — Psyllo, Stack Overflow
</p>

<h2>Part II: Clojure</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-1" >

<h3>Clojure is a Lisp</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Clojure is pronounced exactly like closure, where the s/j has the zh sound as in azure, pleasure etc. The name was chosen to be unique. I wanted to involve c (c#), l (lisp) and j (java). Once I came up with Clojure, given the pun on closure, the available domains and vast emptiness of the googlespace, it was an easy decision. — Rich Hickey
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-2" >

<h3>Closure</h3>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-javascript">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">function</span>() {
    <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">var</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">x</span> = 0;
    <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">function</span>() {
        <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">return</span> x;
    }
})();
</pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes it's called a closure, other times a saved lexical environment. Or, as some of us like to say, let over lambda. — Let Over Lambda, Doug Hoyte
</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">let</span> ((x 0))
    (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">lambda</span> () x))
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-3" >

<h3>Closures are fundamental</h3>
<p>
Closures are the building blocks of lisp. Closures achieve and provide encapsulation of data and functionality in a single, logical unit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Because of this, lisp programmers often don't think in terms of classes and objects. Once assignable value cells and good old lambda expressions are available, object systems are, at best, occasionally useful abstractions and, at worst, special-case and redundant. — Doug Hoyte, Let Over Lambda, Closure Oriented Programming
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-4" >

<h3>Closures and OO</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's possible, for instance, to implement almost all of the design patterns in the Gang of Four book in terms of Lisp macros. Rather than implementing the pattern each time you use it, you just invoke the correct macro and get it for free. — David Chisnall
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-5" >

<h3>Functional vs OO</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whereas an object-oriented mindset will foster the approach of defining an application domain as a set of nouns (classes), the functional mind will see the solution as the composition or verbs (functions). Though both programmers may in all likelihood generate equivalent results, the functional solution will be more succinct, understandable, and reusable. — Michael Fogus, The Joy Clojure
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-6" >

<h3>Clojure's motivation</h3>
<p>
Clojure was born out of frustration provoked in large part by the complexities of concurrent programming, complicated by the weaknesses of object-oriented programming in facilitating it. 
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-7" >

<h3>Simple made easy</h3>
<p>
Something is simple if it is singular: it does one thing, it is made of one thing, etc. Something is easy if it is close at hand, i.e. familiar. Simplicity is objective; easiness is subjective and can be complex.

<h3>Embrace the data</h3>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Persistent data structure
</li>
<li>Immutability
</li>
<li>Reader syntax for maps, vectors, and sets
</li>
<li>Concurrency primitives to work with data on multiple cores
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-10" >

<h3>Stories</h3>
<p>
With the potentials of a modern Lisp and a growing community of smart users, a perfect storm is brewing for a wave of innovation.
Clojure has strong stories for: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Big data 
</li>
<li>Interactive art (games, music, visuals)
</li>
<li>Web development
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-11" >

<h3>Concurrency</h3>
<p>
Two types of concurrency:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">Shared memory</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Message passing</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">Threads</td>
<td class="left">Processes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">Locks</td>
<td class="left">Messages</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">Mutexes</td>
<td class="left">No shared data</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Which does Clojure support?
</p>

</section>
<section id="sec-2-12" >

<h3>JVM</h3>
<p>
Clojure does not replace the Java thread system, rather it works with it. 
</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">
The software transactional memory system (STM) supports sharing changing state between threads in a synchronous and coordinated manner. 
</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">
The agent system supports sharing changing state between threads in an asynchronous and independent manner. 
</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">
The atoms system supports sharing changing state between threads in a synchronous and independent manner. 
</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">
The dynamic var system supports isolating changing state within threads.
</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-13" >

<h3>CSP vs Actor model</h3>
<p>
The Actor Model and CSP diverge in their semantics of message passing.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img src=http://arild.github.io/csp-presentation/images/csp_illustration1.png>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Communication through channels
</li>
<li>Processes are "anonymous"
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<img src=http://arild.github.io/csp-presentation/images/actor_illustration1.png>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Point-to-point communication
</li>
<li>No anonymity
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sec-2-14" >

<h3>CSP</h3>
<p>
Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most successful models for providing high-level linguistic support for concurrency comes from Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes, or CSP. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Implemented as a library in Clojure(script).

<h3>A DOM of Doom</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The browser is a vast source of incompatibility, pain and misery. — Douglas Crockford
</p>
</blockquote>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2Y0U-2qJMs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<blockquote>
<p>
Basically, bugs don’t get fixed in the web. — Douglas Crockford
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-2" >

<h3>Cross-platform libraries and frameworks</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Why are there so many of them? Because there’s a real need. The APIs provided by the browsers are inadequate for doing applications. But Javascript is such a powerful language that it is easily remedied. That’s one reason. Second, they are fun to make, creating little communities of interest around their work. — Douglas Crockford
</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-3" >

<h3>React</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The framework cannot know to separate concerns for you. A React component is a highly cohesive building block for UIs loosely coupled with other components. — Pete Hunt
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Javacript rendering library. Conceptually re-renders on every change. No templating language. Virtual DOM. Diffs for optimization.
