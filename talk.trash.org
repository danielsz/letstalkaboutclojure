** Syntax
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by Adriaan van Wijngaarden and which bears his name. Van Wijngaarden grammars use a context-free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program.

Most modern languages derive their syntax from C, and C derives its syntax from Algol. So they are often called C-like languages, or ALGOL-family languages.

Meeting resistance when trying to rationalize a system. 
We have a terribly poor understanding of what goes on in the brain. We are completely unable to simulate it, and we cannot even recognize what the general form of this computation is, despite decades of experimental data from neurobiologists.
** Thinking about thinking
The brain can reason about itself. It can think in abstractions, recognize patterns and formalize processes. It has notions of inference and validity, and our intuitions are wired to these parts.
Philoshophy and mathematics have been a human activity for as far back as written records exist.

Daniel Kahneman: . Associative memory (it happens without awareness, intuition) vs effortful thinking (deliberate thinking, reflective assessments, meta-deductions, a sense of agency).  are bad at recognizing this. Like chess players that recognize chess situations, we program recognizing problems and solutions with the machinery of intuition (system 1).
There are cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking
** Resistance towards improving rationality of a system by its designers
Because it creates difficulties for the leadership
